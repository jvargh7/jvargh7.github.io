I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at the <a href="https://diabetes.emory.edu/" target="_blank">Emory Global Diabetes Research Center</a> and <a href="https://www.sph.emory.edu/departments/gh/index.html" target="_blank">Hubert Department of Global Health</a>. 

I study continuous glucose monitoring, etiology of Type 2 Diabetes from Electronic Health Records, and social determinants of chronic disease among South Asians.

As part of my <a href="https://nutrition.emory.edu/"><b>PhD</b></a>, I studied how wealth over the life course is associated with cognition and health (physical, mental, socio-emotional) in low- and middle-income countries. My work used data from the <a href="https://academic.oup.com/ije/article/41/3/621/828836" target="_blank">COHORTS collaboration</a>, a consortium of six birth cohorts from five LMICs.
