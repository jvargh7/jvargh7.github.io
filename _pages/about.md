I am a fourth year PhD student in the Nutrition and Health Sciences program at Emory University.

I study how wealth over the life course is associated with cognition and health (physical, mental, socio-emotional) in low- and middle-income countries.
My work uses data from the <a href="https://academic.oup.com/ije/article/41/3/621/828836" target="_blank">COHORTS collaboration</a>, a consortium of six birth cohorts from five LMICs.
