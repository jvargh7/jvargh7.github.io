I am an Assistant Professor at the <a href="https://diabetes.emory.edu/" target="_blank">Emory Global Diabetes Research Center</a> and <a href="https://www.sph.emory.edu/departments/gh/index.html" target="_blank">Hubert Department of Global Health</a>. I currently co-lead the <a href = "https://diabetes.emory.edu/accelerator" target = "_blank">EGDRC Diabetes Translational Accelerator</a> to support PhD students and Advisors in launching their dissertation as a startup.

###  Student Opportunities
My current projects are on the <b><a href="/projects"> projects</a></b> page. I enjoy working with driven and curious <u>Undergraduate</u>, <u>Masters</u> and <u>Doctoral</u> students. Given the nature of the projects I work on, some prior coursework and demonstrating proficiency in programming is ideal. I am happy to [**meet**](https://calendly.com/jvargh7/general) and discuss how we can work together.

As part of my <a href="https://nutrition.emory.edu/"><b>PhD</b></a>, I studied how wealth over the life course is associated with cognition and health (physical, mental, socio-emotional) in low- and middle-income countries. My work used data from the <a href="https://academic.oup.com/ije/article/41/3/621/828836" target="_blank">COHORTS collaboration</a>, a consortium of six birth cohorts from five LMICs.

As part of my Postdoctoral Fellowship, I worked with <a href="https://diabetes.emory.edu/" target="_blank">Global Diabetes Research Center</a> on three topics: diabetes subphenotypes, long COVID (post-acute sequelae) and cardiometabolic disease care continuum.
