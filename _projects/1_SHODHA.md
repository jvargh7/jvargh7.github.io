The **Precision SHODHA** project aims to provide state governments with actionable small areal insights on hypertension, obesity and diabetes care. The proposed project involves harmonizing datasets from national surveys, using small-area estimation techniques and decision sciences frameworks.

This is ongoing work with [Dr. Mohammed K. Ali](https://sph.emory.edu/faculty/profile/index.php?FID=mohammed-ali-372) and [Dr. Nikhil Tandon](https://www.aiims.edu/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=14186&catid=92&lang=en).

We are expanding our collaborations with Emory's Department of Biostatistics and Georgia Tech's School of Industrial and Systems Engineering.

**Funding**: Emory Global Diabetes Research Center Internal Funds
