While non-Europid populations contribute to nearly 80% of the global diabetes burdens, they are grossly underrepresented in precision medicine research.  We undertook an electronic search of literature in PubMed from 2010 to 2023 to identify studies in precision medicine in diabetes in populations from East Asia (EA), Latin America & Caribbean (LAC), Middle East & North Africa (MENA), South Asia (SA) and South East Asia & Pacific Islands (SEAP). We additionally included Central Asia, Central & Eastern Europe, and Sub-Saharan Africa in the subsequent analysis.
