## Cardiometabolic trajectories after SARS-CoV-2 infection

The association between SARS-CoV-2 infection and incident T2DM has yet to be empirically quantified by race
and/or ethnicity using rigorous methods and relevant variables for diverse populations, despite the markedly
higher rates of COVID-19 and T2DM in minority communities. We will use a rigorous analytic approach that
incorporates high-quality data which captures both individual susceptibility and social vulnerability in the
OneFlorida+ Data Trust, a data source that includes large proportions of minority groups, to address this
critical gap in knowledge. The findings from this study will directly inform recommendations for management of
the rapidly growing population of patients experiencing PASC in terms of diabetes screening and
cardiometabolic risk assessment in the months and years after SARS-CoV-2 infection.
