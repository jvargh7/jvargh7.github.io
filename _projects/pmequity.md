While non-Europid populations contribute to nearly 80% of the global diabetes burdens, they are grossly underrepresented in precision medicine research.  We undertook an electronic search of literature in PubMed from 2010 to 2023 to identify studies in precision medicine in diabetes (n > 125,000) in populations from Central Asia, Central & Eastern Europe, East Asia , Latin America & Caribbean, Middle East & North Africa, South Asia, South East Asia & Pacific Islands, and Sub-Saharan Africa as well as North America and Western Europe.
