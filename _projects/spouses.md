Heterosexual and gay couples in romantic relationships are known to influence each other's cardiometabolic risk. The shared risk may be due to two reasons. First is assortative mating (i.e., people marry others similar in socio-economic characteristics or experienced similar environments earlier in life). Second is convergence of health behaviors over time. It’s important to study these dynamics for understanding what, how and when we need to intervene.


This is ongoing work with [Dr. Shivani Patel](https://sph.emory.edu/faculty/profile/index.php?FID=shivani%20a.-patel-8776) and [Dr. Sophia Hussen](https://sph.emory.edu/faculty/profile/index.php?FID=sophia-hussen-8672)
