A novel approach for precision medicine for diabetes involves classifying newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes patients into data-driven subphenotypes based on their clinical characteristics (e.g., age at diagnosis, body mass index, HbA1c, HOMA2-IR, HOMA2-B). These subphenotypes vary in their genetic profile, presentation, responses to antihyperglycemic medication and risk of diabetes-related complications. However, reasons such as unavailability of HOMA2 indices in routinely collected clinical data, scarcity of data on subphenotypes derived from non-European populations, non-replicable cut-points for clinical variables and hard cluster assignment ignoring multifactorial nature of diabetes, preclude the widespread translation of this phenotyping approach from cohort studies to clinical practice.

### Getting Involved
These projects are ideal for advanced masters or doctoral students who want hands-on experience with cohort studies and electronic health record data.

#### If you are interested in adult-onset type 2 diabetes:
1. Classify subphenotypes of newly diagnosed adult type 2 diabetes from cohort studies using variables available in electronic health records
2. Visualize distribution of subphenotypes in EHR systems by county, race-ethnicity, sex, and age groups
3. Describe trends in prescribed medications, clinical parameters, and risk of complications among EHR-derived newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes subphenotypes. 
4. Develop a ‘2-year risk’ multi-class prediction model for phenotype membership using electronic health records from two clinical research networks and evaluate domain generalization

#### If you are interested in youth-onset type 2 diabetes:
5. Develop a novel classification of newly diagnosed, youth-onset type 2 diabetes using clinical characteristics from cohort studies, and compare the classification with adult-onset subphenotypes
6. Describe the longitudinal association of T2DM subphenotypes among youth-onset type 2 diabetes and Michigan Neuropathy Screening Instrument (MNSI) scores
7. Describe the association of youth-onset T2DM subphenotypes and distal symmetric polyneuropathy phenotypes based on the Michigan Neuropathy Screening Instrument (MNSI)
