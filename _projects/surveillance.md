## Precision Surveillance of Hypertension, Obesity and Diabetes for Healthy Aging

The **Precision SHODHA** project aims to provide state and local governments with actionable small areal insights on hypertension, obesity and diabetes care in USA and India. The proposed project involves harmonizing datasets from national surveys and administrative sources, use small-area estimation techniques and decision sciences frameworks.

This is ongoing work with [Dr. Mohammed K. Ali](https://sph.emory.edu/faculty/profile/index.php?FID=mohammed-ali-372), [Dr. Nikhil Tandon](https://www.aiims.edu/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=14186&catid=92&lang=en) and [Erica Kocher](https://sph.emory.edu/phd-students/profile/index.php?FID=erica-kocher-13051).

We collaborate with Emory's Department of Biostatistics ([Emily Peterson](https://sph.emory.edu/faculty/profile/index.php?FID=emily-peterson-12642)) and Georgia Tech's School of Industrial and Systems Engineering ([Gian Gabriel Garcia](https://giangabrielgarcia.com/)).
